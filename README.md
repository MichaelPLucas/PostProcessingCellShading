# PostProcessingCellShading
A look at what cell shading could look like if done as a post-processing effect rather than a shader.

TO DO:
- Clean up resolution scaling
- Port ruby K-means code to python
- Optimize python code where possible
- Consider using less external libs to further optimize?
- Attempt more image denoising on finished product (maybe)
